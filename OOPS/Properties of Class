A class does not take any byte of memory.
A class is just like a real-world entity, but it is not a real-world entity. It's a blueprint where we specify the functionalities.
A class contains mainly two things: Methods and Data Members.
A class can also be a nested class.
Classes follow all of the rules of OOPs such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, etc.
